<h1>Learn HTML by building a cat photo app </h1>

HTML tags give a webpage its structure. You can use HTML tags to add photos, buttons, and other elements to your webpage.

In this course, you'll learn the most common HTML tags by building your own cat photo app.

<h3>Step 1 </h3>

<html>
  <body>
<p> </p>HTML elements have opening tags like < h1 > and closing tags like < /h1 >.</p>

The text for an element goes between its opening and closing tags.

Find the h1 element and change its text to:

CatPhotoApp

 < h1 >Hello World< /h1 >

  </body>
</html>

<html>
  <body>
<h3>Step 2</h3>
The h1 through h6 heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. 
The lower the number, the higher the importance, so h2 elements have less importance than h1 elements. 
Only use one h1 element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.

Below the h1 element, add an h2 element with this text:

Cat Photos

</html>
  </body>
